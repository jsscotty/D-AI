<strong>[blona](https://www.blona.ai/)</strong> is the AI Assistant connected to your company's docs, apps, and people. 
blona provides a Chat interface and plugs into any LLM of your choice. blona can be deployed anywhere and for any 
scale - on a laptop, on-premise, or to cloud. Since you own the deployment, your user data and chats are fully in your 
own control. blona is MIT licensed and designed to be modular and easily extensible. The system also comes fully ready 
for production usage with user authentication, role management (admin/basic users), chat persistence, and a UI for 
configuring Personas (AI Assistants) and their Prompts.

blona also serves as a Unified Search across all common workplace tools such as Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, etc.
By combining LLMs and team specific knowledge, blona becomes a subject matter expert for the team. Imagine ChatGPT if
it had access to your team's unique knowledge! It enables questions such as "A customer wants feature X, is this already
supported?" or "Where's the pull request for feature Y?"
